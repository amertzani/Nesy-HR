# System Overview: High-Level Architecture Description

## Architecture Overview for HR Decision Support

Our system implements a three-layer architecture designed to support HR professionals in evidence-based decision-making through transparent, traceable information access. The architecture consists of: (1) a React/TypeScript frontend layer providing a conversational interface, interactive knowledge graph visualization, and comprehensive fact inspection capabilities; (2) a Python/FastAPI backend layer implementing a multi-agent orchestration system with specialized agents for different processing tasks; and (3) an RDF knowledge graph layer (RDFLib) serving as the central storage system that maintains all extracted facts with complete provenance metadata including source documents, upload timestamps, agent identifiers, and confidence scores. This layered design ensures separation of concerns while maintaining end-to-end traceability from source documents through fact extraction to query responses.

The system employs a multi-agent architecture with eight specialized agents that work collaboratively to process HR documents and answer queries. When HR documents (CSV, PDF, DOCX) are uploaded, Document Agents coordinate processing by breaking documents into chunks that Worker Agents process in parallel to extract facts, which are then stored in the knowledge graph with complete source attribution. Simultaneously, specialized agents perform parallel analysis: the Statistics Agent computes correlations and distributions, the Operational Query Agent generates insights through groupby operations (e.g., department performance metrics, absence patterns), and the Visualization Agent creates charts for visual exploration. When HR professionals pose queries through the conversational interface, the Orchestrator Agent intelligently routes queries to appropriate agents based on query type (structured, operational, statistical, or conversational), retrieves relevant facts from the knowledge graph, assembles evidence, and generates natural language responses that include supporting facts with source attribution.

This architecture is specifically designed to address the needs of HR professionals by providing transparent, explainable, and traceable information access. Every response includes evidence facts that users can inspect and verify, enabling HR professionals to make informed decisions with confidence in the system's reasoning. The knowledge graph serves as both a storage system and an audit trail, maintaining complete provenance information that enables users to trace any piece of information back to its source document. The conversational interface allows HR professionals to interact with the system using natural language without requiring technical expertise, while the interactive graph visualization and knowledge base table views enable deeper exploration of entity relationships and underlying data. This combination of transparency, traceability, and human-centric design ensures that HR professionals can leverage AI-powered information access while maintaining control, understanding, and accountability over the decision-making process.
